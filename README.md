# Lasso
> Lasso is a work in progress library for simplifying deployment of docker images on AWS.  It's also an excuse for me to learn the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) library, which introduces a whole new form of interactive development.  All the things you like about Jupyter, but integrates with real dev tools the way you need it to.  


This file will become your README and also the index of your documentation.
